/**
 * @brief Manages the suspension and resumption of a coroutine based on a suspend count.
 *
 * The `coroutine_suspender` class is responsible for controlling the suspension state of a coroutine.
 * It tracks the number of outstanding suspensions and resumes the coroutine when the suspend count reaches zero.
 * This class is move-only and not copyable.
 *
 * @note The suspend count is managed atomically. The coroutine is resumed either immediately or scheduled
 * for execution on any thread, depending on which method is called. Method `try_to_continue_immediately` should be called at least once.
 *
 * @see try_to_continue_from_any_thread
