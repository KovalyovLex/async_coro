/**
 * @brief Abstract interface for execution systems
 *
 * The i_execution_system interface defines the contract for execution systems
 * that can schedule and execute asynchronous tasks across different execution queues.
 * This interface provides a unified abstraction for task execution regardless of
 * the underlying implementation (single-threaded, multi-threaded, etc.).
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Task scheduling and execution management
 * - Execution queue routing and prioritization
 * - Thread capability checking and task distribution
 * - Support for immediate execution when possible
 *
 * Implementations of this interface can provide different execution strategies:
 * - Multi-threaded execution with worker pools
 * - Single-threaded execution for testing or simple scenarios
 * - Custom execution strategies for specific use cases
 *
 * @note All methods in this interface are thread-safe unless otherwise specified
 * @note Implementations should ensure proper resource management and thread safety
