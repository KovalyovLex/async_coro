 * scheduling and executing tasks.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Multiple worker threads with configurable task permissions
 * - Thread-safe task queuing and execution
 * - Support for different execution queues (main, worker, any)
 * - Automatic task distribution based on thread capabilities
 * - Main thread integration for immediate task execution
 *
 * @note This class should only be created from the main thread that will call update_from_main()
 * @note The execution system automatically manages thread lifecycle and task distribution
